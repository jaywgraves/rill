## More enhancements to Rill Developer
We have continued to enhance Rill Developer with more error notifications, hints and performance improvements.  
Files will now indicate errors in the file listing view to easily allow you to glance your project structure to understand if there are any reconcile or syntax errors within your files.

## Contacting support is just a click away in Rill Cloud
You can now easily chat with Support in Rill Cloud as a administrator. You will find the new functionality under your profile in Rill Cloud and will give you a direct line to support ready to answer whatever questions you might have! 

## More time functions for Metrics SQL
Using Metrics SQL you can easily query a Rill Metrics view in a SQL-like syntax. We have now added support for `date_add`, `date_sub` and `now` that allows you to use time more effectively to query your data.

## Uninstall Rill
Want to easily uninstall Rill? ðŸ˜¢  
We have added a `uninstall` command to the CLI as such, `rill uninstall`
